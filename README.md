# Data-Structures-Project
Dijkstra's algorithm application

Worked with 3 other computer science students on this project. The goal was to implement Djisktra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two buildings on campus.
Notre Dame's campus is located in a very cold area in South Bend, IN, and we often walk through multiple buildings to warm up on the way to our destination. This project
finds the shortest path going in through buildings on the way between an origin and destination. The program takes in a two text files as command line arguments. The first one is the names of all the buildings that make up the graph, and the second has the edges and weights between the buildings which describe the path and distance respectively. Program.c then builds the graph and prompts the user to enter the origin and destination. Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented and the shortest path is displayed to the user.
